## FullStack React GraphQL Typescript Learning

This repo is my follow along for the ben awad [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ypD7qv3Z8).

I'll be using this stack for start with self however want to address some learning hole for production grade web application development.

### Notes (While following along).

#### Postgresql

The command is `sudo -i -u postgres` then you can access the postgres prompt via `psql`. If you cannot do so it's likely that your local db is not up and running. `sudo service postgresql start`. Then `sudo -u postgres psql` should work fine to connect as the admin postgres user.

#### MikrORM

Data mapping and migrations done with MikrOrm.
